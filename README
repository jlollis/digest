Scripts to generates a daily digest PDF in pocketmod booklet form to print out and enjoy.

It doesn't do much yet, I'm slowly filling in the pages of the booklet. I'll add them here in the order they appear:

1. Last.fm event recommendations
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
7. 
8. 

Required libs:
- pylast 0.3 branch (slightly modified â€” ask for details): http://code.google.com/p/pylast/
- ReportLab: http://www.reportlab.org/

You'll also need a settings module which defines these globals:
GMAPS_KEY
LASTFM_KEY
LASTFM_SECRET
LASTFM_SESSION

APIs:
- Google Static Maps: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/staticmaps/
- Last.fm: http://www.last.fm/api
